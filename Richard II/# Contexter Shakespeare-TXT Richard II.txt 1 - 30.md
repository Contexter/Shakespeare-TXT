**ACT I** | **ACT I**
**SCENE I. London. KING RICHARD II's palace.** | **SCENE I. London. KING RICHARD II's palace.**
Enter KING RICHARD II, JOHN OF GAUNT, with other Nobles and Attendants | Enter KING RICHARD II, JOHN OF GAUNT, with other Nobles and Attendants
**KING RICHARD II** | **KING RICHARD II**
Old John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster, | Old John of Gaunt, the honored Lancaster,
Hast thou, according to thy oath and band, | Have you, in line with your promise and bond,
Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son, | Brought here Henry Hereford, your bold son,
Here to make good the boisterous late appeal, | To address the serious challenge recently issued,
Which then our leisure would not let us hear, | Which we were too busy to hear at the time,
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray? | Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?
**JOHN OF GAUNT** | **JOHN OF GAUNT**
I have, my liege. | Yes, my liege.
**KING RICHARD II** | **KING RICHARD II**
Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him, | Tell me more, have you checked whether he
If he appeal the duke on ancient malice; | Challenges the duke out of long-standing grudge;
Or worthily, as a good subject should, | Or rightfully, as a loyal subject would,
On some known ground of treachery in him? | Because of some proven betrayal by him?
**JOHN OF GAUNT** | **JOHN OF GAUNT**
As near as I could sift him on that argument, | As much as I could probe into that matter,
On some apparent danger seen in him | Based on some clear risk seen in him
Aim'd at your highness, no inveterate malice. | Aimed at you, your highness, no deep-seated hate.
**KING RICHARD II** | **KING RICHARD II**
Then call them to our presence; face to face, | Then let's bring them before us, face to face,
And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear | And eye to eye, we will personally listen
The accuser and the accused freely speak: | To both the accuser and the accused speak openly:
High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire, | Both are high-spirited and full of anger,
In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire. | Quick to rage like the sea, impulsive as fire.
Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and THOMAS MOWBRAY | Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and THOMAS MOWBRAY
