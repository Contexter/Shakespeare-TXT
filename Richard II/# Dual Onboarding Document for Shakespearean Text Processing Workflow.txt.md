To incorporate the detailed explanation on how to accurately produce .fountain documents that juxtapose original Shakespearean text with its modernized version, the updated instructions would include the following added clarification under section 3, **Creating a .fountain Juxtaposition:**

1. **Fetching the Requested Shakespearean Text:**
   - When a request is made to fetch a specific range of lines from a Shakespearean play, utilize the `FetchFileContent` function from the `github_repo_query_wk9q8ybc6b_replit_app__jit_plugin`. The request will include the exact `owner`, `repo`, `file_path`, and `start_line` to `end_line` range needed to retrieve the text.

2. **Modernizing the Text:**
   - After retrieving the specified lines, translate the Shakespearean English into modern English. This step requires preserving the original meaning and nuances but updating the language to make it accessible and understandable to a contemporary audience.

3. **Creating a .fountain Juxtaposition:**
   - Format both the original Shakespearean text and its modernized version in the .fountain screenplay format for juxtaposition. This involves:
     - Writing the character names in ALL CAPS for both the original and the modernized dialogue.
     - For the modernized dialogue, appending a caret (^) directly to the character's name without a space to indicate the modernized version of the text. This symbol serves to differentiate the modernized dialogue from the original in a visual manner, representing a form of dual dialogue within the screenplay format.
     - Placing the character's dialogue immediately below their name, ensuring there's a new line for the dialogue to maintain clarity and readability.
     - Inserting a blank line before each character's name to separate different pieces of dialogue clearly, enhancing the structure and flow of the text.

4. **Create .fountain downloads, adhering to a Naming Convention:**
   - For organizational clarity, we use a consistent naming convention for the file downloads: `[PlayName]_[StartLine]-[EndLine].[format]`. This approach helps us keep track of the various outputs and ensure they are easily identifiable and retrievable for post-processing.

#### Final Outputs
At the end of our process, you will receive downloadable files in both .fountain formats. These files will contain the original Shakespearean text and its modernized version, formatted for easy comparison and study, with the modernized dialogue visually distinguished by a caret (^) to indicate its nature as a contemporary interpretation of the original lines.
