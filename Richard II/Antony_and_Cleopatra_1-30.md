| 1  | PHILO        | Nay, but this dotage of our general's O'erflows the measure:                                      | No, but our general's excessive admiration really goes too far:                               |
| 2  |              | those his goodly eyes, That o'er the files and musters of the war Have glow'd like plated Mars,   | his admirable eyes, which once scrutinized the ranks and preparations of war with a Mars-like gleam, |
| 3  |              | now bend, now turn, The office and devotion of their view Upon a tawny front:                     | are now turned, now bent, focusing their attention and admiration on a dark complexion:       |
| 4  |              | his captain's heart, Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst The buckles on his breast,  | his warrior's heart, which in the heat of major battles burst the straps on his armor,        |
| 5  |              | reneges all temper, And is become the bellows and the fan To cool a gipsy's lust.                 | has lost all restraint and has become the means to fan the flames of a gypsy's desire.        |
| 6  | CLEOPATRA    | If it be love indeed, tell me how much.                                                           | If this is really love, tell me how deep it is.                                               |
| 7  | MARK ANTONY  | There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.                                                 | There's poverty in a love that can be measured.                                               |
| 8  | CLEOPATRA    | I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved.                                                           | I'll set a limit to how much to be loved.                                                     |
| 9  | MARK ANTONY  | Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.                                              | Then you'll have to discover a new heaven, new earth.                                         |
