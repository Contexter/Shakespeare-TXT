| Enter KING RICHARD II, JOHN OF GAUNT, with other Nobles and Attendants | King Richard II and John of Gaunt enter, along with other nobles and attendants. |
| **KING RICHARD II:** Old John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster, Hast thou, according to thy oath and band, Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son, Here to make good the boisterous late appeal, Which then our leisure would not let us hear, Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray? | **KING RICHARD II:** John of Gaunt, honored Lancaster, have you, following your oath, brought your bold son Henry Hereford here, to address the serious accusation he made before, which we didn't have time to listen to, against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray? |
| **JOHN OF GAUNT:** I have, my liege. | **JOHN OF GAUNT:** Yes, my king. |
| **KING RICHARD II:** Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him, If he appeal the duke on ancient malice; Or worthily, as a good subject should, On some known ground of treachery in him? | **KING RICHARD II:** Furthermore, have you figured out if his challenge to the duke is based on old resentment, or rightfully, as a loyal subject should, on some proven act of betrayal by him? |
| **JOHN OF GAUNT:** As near as I could sift him on that argument, On some apparent danger seen in him Aim'd at your highness, no inveterate malice. | **JOHN OF GAUNT:** From what I could gather, it seems he sees some clear danger in him that threatens you, my king, not out of longstanding hatred. |
| **KING RICHARD II:** Then call them to our presence; face to face, And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear The accuser and the accused freely speak: High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire, In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire. | **KING RICHARD II:** Then have them both brought before us, face to face. We will personally listen to both the accuser and the accused speak openly: they are both highly temperamental and filled with anger, impetuous as the sea, and quick as fire. |
| Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and THOMAS MOWBRAY | Henry Bolingbroke and Thomas Mowbray enter. |
