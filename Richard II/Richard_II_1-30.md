| 2  | Introduction    | Enter KING RICHARD II, JOHN OF GAUNT, with other Nobles and Attendants                                                        | King Richard II, John of Gaunt, and other nobles and attendants enter the scene.                                                                                 |
| 3  | KING RICHARD II | Old John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster, Hast thou, according to thy oath and band, Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son, Here to make good the boisterous late appeal, Which then our leisure would not let us hear, Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray? | John of Gaunt, esteemed Lancaster, have you, as you swore, brought your courageous son Henry Hereford here to address the recent serious accusation that we previously had no time to hear, against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray? |
| 4  | JOHN OF GAUNT   | I have, my liege.                                                                                                              | Yes, my king.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 5  | KING RICHARD II | Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him, If he appeal the duke on ancient malice; Or worthily, as a good subject should, On some known ground of treachery in him? | Furthermore, have you assessed whether his challenge against the duke stems from old resentment or, as a loyal subject should, from some concrete evidence of treachery on the duke's part?                           |
| 6  | JOHN OF GAUNT   | As near as I could sift him on that argument, On some apparent danger seen in him Aim'd at your highness, no inveterate malice.  | From what I could gather, his action seems to be based on a perceived threat to you, my king, rather than deep-seated hatred.                                                                |
| 7  | KING RICHARD II | Then call them to our presence; face to face, And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear The accuser and the accused freely speak: High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire, In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire. | Then have them brought before us to confront each other directly. We'll listen to both the accuser and the accused speak openly. They are both very proud and quick to anger, as unhearing as the sea and as quick as fire in their rage. |
