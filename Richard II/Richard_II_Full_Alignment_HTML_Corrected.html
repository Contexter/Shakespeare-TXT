        <pre>The Life and Death of Richard the Second
**** ACT I ****
**** SCENE I. London. KING RICHARD II's palace. ****
     Enter KING RICHARD II, JOHN OF GAUNT, with other Nobles and
     Attendants
KING RICHARD II
Old John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster,
Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,
Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son,
Here to make good the boisterous late appeal,
Which then our leisure would not let us hear,
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?

JOHN OF GAUNT
I have, my liege.

KING RICHARD II
Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,
If he appeal the duke on ancient malice;
Or worthily, as a good subject should,
On some known ground of treachery in him?

JOHN OF GAUNT
As near as I could sift him on that argument,
On some apparent danger seen in him
Aim'd at your highness, no inveterate malice.

KING RICHARD II
Then call them to our presence; face to face,
And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear
The accuser and the accused freely speak:
High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,
In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.
Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and THOMAS MOWBRAY</pre>

        <pre>The Life and Death of Richard the Second
**** ACT I ****
**** SCENE I. London. KING RICHARD II's palace. ****
     Enter KING RICHARD II, JOHN OF GAUNT, with other Nobles and
     Attendants
KING RICHARD II^
John of Gaunt, esteemed Lancaster,
Did you bring your son Henry Hereford here,
As you swore, to address the recent serious challenge,
A matter we previously had no time to hear,
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?

JOHN OF GAUNT^
I did, my king.

KING RICHARD II^
And have you assessed if his challenge comes
From an old grudge or a valid accusation
Of treachery that a loyal subject should rightfully make?

JOHN OF GAUNT^
I've looked into it as much as I could,
And it seems he sees a direct threat in him
Aimed at you, with no underlying malice.

KING RICHARD II^
Then let's have them here, face to face,
We will personally hear from both the accuser and the accused:
They are both fiercely proud and angry,
Deaf to reason in their anger, quick to act.
Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and THOMAS MOWBRAY</pre>
