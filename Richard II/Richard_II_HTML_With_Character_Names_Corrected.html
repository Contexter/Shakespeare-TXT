        <pre>The Life and Death of Richard the Second
**** ACT I ****
**** SCENE I. London. KING RICHARD II's palace. ****
     Enter KING RICHARD II, JOHN OF GAUNT, with other Nobles and
     Attendants
KING RICHARD II
Old John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster,
Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,
Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son,
Here to make good the boisterous late appeal,
Which then our leisure would not let us hear,
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?

JOHN OF GAUNT
I have, my liege.

KING RICHARD II
Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,
If he appeal the duke on ancient malice;
Or worthily, as a good subject should,
On some known ground of treachery in him?

JOHN OF GAUNT
As near as I could sift him on that argument,
On some apparent danger seen in him
Aim'd at your highness, no inveterate malice.

KING RICHARD II
Then call them to our presence; face to face,
And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear
The accuser and the accused freely speak:
High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,
In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.
Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and THOMAS MOWBRAY</pre>

        <pre>KING RICHARD II^
John of Gaunt, you've been respected for ages,
Have you, true to your promise,
Brought your brave son Henry Hereford here,
To settle the loud dispute we couldn't attend to before,
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?

JOHN OF GAUNT^
Yes, my king.

KING RICHARD II^
Tell me more, have you checked if his challenge
To the duke is based on old grudges;
Or rightfully, as a loyal subject would,
On proven treachery by the duke?

JOHN OF GAUNT^
From what I could gather, he sees a clear threat in him
Aimed at you, my lord, no deep-seated hatred.

KING RICHARD II^
Then bring them before us; let them face each other,
And we'll listen to both the accuser and the accused speak freely:
They are both proud and angry,
As deaf to reason in their rage as the sea, as quick to action as fire.
Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and THOMAS MOWBRAY</pre>
